# FFB (Fresh Fruit Bunches) Classification with ResNet50 & Knowledge Distillation

This project focuses on the fine-grained classification of **Fresh Fruit Bunches (FFB)** using deep convolutional neural networks. A ResNet50 backbone was used as the base model to establish performance benchmarks. Further experiments were conducted with larger models and knowledge distillation techniques to explore the trade-off between model size, accuracy, and memory efficiency â€” with a goal toward real-world deployment on resource-constrained systems.
